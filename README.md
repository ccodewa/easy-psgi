Easy PSGI Programming
=====================

Some really simple sample PSGI programs that are written simply to
demonstrate that you don't need use web frameworks to move your code
from CGI to PSGI.

The sample programs are based on the code in 
[a series of three articles on CGI programming](http://perlhacks.com/articles/cgi-programming/)
that I wrote for Linux Format back in 2000.

**Note:** I'm not saying that I think this is the best way of writing
web programs in Perl. I am saying that this is a reasonably easy way to
port old CGI programs to PSGI.
